### 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

# Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance in Python

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass/base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchy between classes.

### Syntax:

```python
class BaseClass:
    # Base class attributes and methods

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # Derived class inherits from BaseClass
