## Python - Object-relational mapping

This repository delves into what ORM's are and its importance for Python developers to interact with MySQL databases using `SQLAlchemy`, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.

### Key Terms:

- SQLAlchemy: A Python library that provides a way to interact with relational databases using Python objects and syntax. It simplifies database management by abstracting away the complexities of database interactions.

- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): A programming technique that allows developers to map database tables to Python classes and rows to objects. It enables developers to work with databases using an object-oriented approach, making database interactions more intuitive.

- MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing and querying data. It is widely used in web development and other applications requiring data storage and retrieval.

- CRUD Operations: An acronym for `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete` operations, which are the four basic functions for persistent storage in a database. These operations are commonly performed when interacting with databases to manage data.

- Session: In SQLAlchemy, a session represents a collection of objects that are currently in memory and are associated with a database transaction. Sessions are used to manage database interactions, including committing changes to the database or rolling them back.

- Querying: The process of retrieving data from a database using a query language such as SQL. In SQLAlchemy, querying is done using Pythonic syntax, allowing developers to write queries in a way that is familiar and intuitive to Python programmers.

By leveraging SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities, developers can efficiently manage MySQL databases in their Python applications, making database interactions easier and more efficient.
