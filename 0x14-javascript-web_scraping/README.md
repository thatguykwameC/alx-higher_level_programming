## JavaScript - Web scraping

This project is all about grabbing info (scraping) from a website using JavaScript! Imagine you want cool stuff from a website, like funny cat pictures. This project shows how to get that data with JavaScript and save it in a file. It uses: `request` to fetch the website and `fs` to write the data to a file.
